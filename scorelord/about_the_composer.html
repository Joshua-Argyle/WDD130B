        My name is Josh Argyle, a contemporary composer for both
orchestra and piano. With a love for the works of past
composers such as Beethoven, Dvorak, and Wagner, to the
modern film scores of John Williams, Hans Zimmer, and
Ludwig Goransson, I have grown up with a love for a great
deal of different kinds of music. One of the greatest goals of
my music is to represent various styles and genres in a
singular work. My works cover modern, neoclassical, and
even jazz styles. If you want to listen to a variety of music,
this is the place!

    <p id="childhood">As a kid I was always fascinated by the scores in
        film, often tinkering on the piano what I heard
        from a movie I watched the night before, even
        though I was supposed to be practicing my
        scales. While at the time my piano teacher would
        find my tinkering as somewhat of an annoyance
        and hinderer to my growth, it later became my
        passion as I became a more knowledgeable
        musician. I now see that tinkering as my drive to
        compose!</p>
