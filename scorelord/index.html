    <h3>Inspired By Music You Love</h3>
    <p>
        Check out my originals like Veil Waters, which is inspired by the renowned Hollow Knight soundtrack. My inspired, not arranged, works are fresh but yet familiar to the music you know and love.

    <h6>
        Requests
    </h6>

    <p>
        Much of my music comes from requests people give me! While there is certainly music I strive to create, I also put priority in trying new things. Leave a comment on one of my videos, or message me directly and I would be happy to consider your request!
