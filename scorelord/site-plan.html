        Welcome to my site! Here you will find the latest news and information about SCORELORD, as well as partner channels such as Mash-Up Piano and my personal channel. You can read up on the inspiration that went into each of my works, as well as a unique look into the creative processes I undergo. Easily access all my content across YouTube, musicnotes.com, and so forth.
        Requests:
        Much of my music comes from requests people give me! While there is certain music I strive to create, I also put priority in trying new things. Leave a comment on one of my videos, or message me directly and I would be happy to consider your request! 
        Also, if you are a fan of my mashups and think a couple pieces would go really good together, send me a request!
        Piano Sheet Music:
        Looking for something new to play? Or want to play for yourself one of my compositions? Much of my music has been transcribed or created for solo piano. My Mashup Piano arrangements are a fuse between two pieces, such as my Gymnopedie X Zelda arrangement.  My SCORELORD pieces are primarily originals that have been adapted for solo piano. 
        My sheets are found on musicnotes.com, which is one of the biggest names in the sheet music business. With their unique music notation that is both easy to read and easily accessible through their app, you can take the highest of quality sheets with you anywhere whether printed or through the app. 
        Collaboration:
        If you are a musician, filmmaker, or any other creative person wanting to collaborate with me, feel free to reach out via Facebook or YouTube. As long as my schedule permits, I am often open to working on a piece of music with you. 
        I am usually also open to the use of my music in your projects, such as background music for a YouTube video, Advertisement, or even playlist, so long as I receive credit for such use. The use of my music can help me and you, as it can hopefully elevate your project at hand, as well as get my music more welcome publicity!

      <h3>About the Composer</h3>
      <p>
        About me: 
        My name is Josh Argyle, a contemporary composer for both orchestra and piano. With a love for the works of past composers such as Beethoven, Dvorak, and Wagner, to the modern film scores of John Williams, Hans Zimmer, and Ludwig Goransson, I have grown up with a love for a great deal of different kinds of music.
        One of the greatest goals of my music is to represent various styles and genres in a singular work. My works cover modern, neoclassical, and even jazz styles. If you want to listen to a variety of music, check out my channel!
        As a kid I was always fascinated by the scores in film, often tinkering on the piano what I heard from a movie I watched the night before, even though I was supposed to be practicing my scales. While at the time my piano teacher would find my tinkering as somewhat of an annoyance and hinderer to my growth, it later became my passion as I became a more knowledgeable musician. I now see that tinkering as my drive to compose!
